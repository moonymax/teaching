A number of unproven ways of teaching

## Time to feedback
Given sufficient interest in a problem some particularly obsessed individuals will be able to carry the entirety of their thought process, about that problem, into the distant future, where a definitive objective feedback will resolve all their ponderings and stipulations. Normal people and especially students, however, will have forgotten the problem statement by the time you finished your sentence.


Short time to feedback does wonders once any attention is there at all. This principle extends into the millisecond range and is something that even great platforms like brilliant.org still get wrong (please make animations optional).

## Time horizons
Toddlers have a planning horizon of "right this second". You are just a bigger toddler.
Like a toddler you should increase the difficulty and time horizons of achievements progressively. This is directly proportional to how capable you are.

## Interest and motivation

How capable someone is is not specifically related to the types of problems but the difficulty of problems one can solve. Problems in the real world often take far longer than a few minutes. Often they take hours, days, weeks and in the case of governments even decades if at all, to solve.

Students however are often restricted to problems that span only a lesson or two.

One would hope that students learn from the best problem solvers. However, the average teacher is, well, average. Average is by no means terrible, but it also isn't great.

Often times smaller classes are proclaimed as the answer. This, rather expensive, solution then quickly gets followed up with something like "Teachers should be paid more to make their jobs more desirable". While in recent times throwing money at the problem and scaling up has been shown to make stunning progress on quite general problems, maybe lets not start with the expensive solutions.

Now lets consider a theoreticaly teacher who is truly great at teaching. A teacher like that wouldn't be restricted by the number of students they are teaching.

Among software engineers there is the mystical idea of the 10x or 100x engineer. One engineer that can do as much as 10 or even 100 others. Often times normal egineers will claim that such engineers don't exist or discount them as "engineers that cause 10x more problems". And yet small companies that solve problems that companies with all the engineers in the world couldn't solve seem to continously spring out of nowhere. Rarely do those companies do the same things as larger ones.

Similarly youtube videos, with millions upon millions of views, with streams of comments thanking the creator of that video, claiming that it has managed to explain a difficult concept which their teachers or professors couldn't, exist in droves. Youtube, a particularly unidirectional communication method, seems to thrive with explainers that make truly difficult concepts graspable.

These videos heavily rely on (intuition and visualizations)[https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/videos]. After all youtube is a rather visual medium. 

However, even before youtube teachers, with profound teaching skill, have existed. One famous example is (Richard Feynman)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pIYI5JQLE].

With a good intuition, which is fundamentally all you need, rigurousness can be rederived. In the real world knowing how to find the knowledge or tools just as they are needed is often far more valuable than already knowing or having a fixed set of tools without the ability gain new ones on the fly. Skills gained through great difficulty also tend to ingrain themselves more deeply into your permanent skill set.

There is a point to be made for brute force repetition. As it can allow us to learn paricularly unintuitve mechanisms like chess or a rubiks cube to a rather astonishing degree.

The problem with the unreasonable effectiveness of repetition is that it only yields great results if its terribly demotivating experience is endured for long enough. 

let us venture into the land of less rigurousness. There is evidence for what I say, but it is not as rigurous as a measurement would be.

School curriculums have the problem of prescribing how solving small problems is the way to solving bigger problems. Or prescribing dependency trees of concepts where the most fundamental concepts, on which all other concepts are built on, are taught first.

Prescribing and enforcing rules that govern small scopes in order to achieve a big goal is ineffective and beside the point. This often tends to be an issue with religions. Schools unfortunately do the very same.

While school curriculums are oriented along the "fundamentals first" approach they still fail to be truly fundamentals first. Not that succeding in persuing this approach would be good.

Lets take you for example. You are competent I assume. You can, add, multiply, perhaps you can even do things more complicated than that. You didn't start out learning about the 1 + 1 = 2 proof and you turned out fine.

Solving a difficult but doable problem is the way. Depth first ist the way.
